Do you want to start a repo like this? not so hard! Head over to [the template repository at HackYourFutureBelgium](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-repo-template/) and follow these instructions:

1. set up a new repo for your class
    * either by cloning
        1. start an empty repository in your organization
        1. clone this repo
        1. replace all instances of `class-repo-template` with the name of your new class
        1. set your new repo as a remote
        1. push
    * or [generate from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
1. set up the class overview app
    1. turn on github pages
    1. update the `repoName` and `userName` in `./app/data/index.json`
    1. add your students to `./app/data/students.js` (`{name:"student name", userName: "githubUserName"}`)
1. set up the wiki in your new repo
    1. enable wikis in your new repo
    1. enable editing for non-contributors (if you want to)
    1. clone the wiki from this template repo
    1. replace all instances of `class-repo-template` with your new repo name
    1. push to your new repo's wiki
1. copy the template project board to your repo, one for each module


> if you're using this repo outside of the HackYourFutureBelgium organization, you'll need to update a few links to make sure that the class repo is consistently pointing to itself where necessary.
>
> Once you think it's set up spend a half hour or so navigating the repo to make sure you didn't miss any
